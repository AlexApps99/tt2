  <h1>Testing Time FAQs</h1>

  <h2>Why is testing my water important?</h2>
Testing your water is not only important to ensure the safety of your family, but also the safety of your community. By using our website you are able to input data from testing your own water to compare it to other people in your community.

<h2>What is the next step?</h2>
If there are any recurring issues in the community we will be able to take the data and send it to the communityâ€™s local council. This would allow them to take the appropriate actions required.
 
<h2>What will the kit test for?</h2>
The kit will test for nitrate, nitrite, pH, total hardness, free chlorine in your drinking water.

<h2>What water can I test?</h2>
Our tests are only appropriate for testing your drinking tap water.

<h2>Can I use these tests to test the quality of my water tank?</h2>
As of now our tests are only for mains water. However we are looking to expand our kits in the future.
